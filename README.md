# Power Query Data Quality Toolkit

This repository contains a small collection of **Power Query (M)** scripts for basic **data quality checks** that can be used in Power BI or other ETL processes.

The goal is to make it easy to:
- Detect missing or invalid values  
- Identify duplicate or inconsistent records  
- Flag outliers or suspicious data points  
- Validate data types and allowed value lists  
- Monitor data freshness and update frequency  

Each function is written in plain M code, kept modular and reusable across projects.

Example use cases:
- Run quick data quality checks during model development  
- Feed results into a “Data Quality Dashboard” in Power BI  
- Share standard checks across your BI team  

Feel free to copy, adapt, and extend for your own workflows.
